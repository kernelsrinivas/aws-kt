# Top 10 Solutions Architect Level AWS Lambda Interview Questions

1. How would you architect a serverless solution using AWS Lambda to handle high-availability and disaster recovery across multiple AWS regions?
2. What strategies would you recommend to secure a Lambda-based application at scale, including IAM roles, VPC access, and encryption?
3. How would you design a real-time data processing pipeline using AWS Lambda, Kinesis, and S3, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance?
4. How do you design event-driven architectures using AWS Lambda to ensure loose coupling between services and handle asynchronous events?
5. What factors do you consider when deciding between AWS Lambda and other compute services (e.g., EC2, ECS, Fargate) in a cloud architecture?
6. How would you implement a multi-tenant serverless solution using AWS Lambda and ensure data isolation and scalability for each tenant?
7. What are the key design patterns to consider when integrating AWS Lambda with databases (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB) in a high-throughput environment?
8. How would you architect a hybrid cloud solution using AWS Lambda and on-premises resources, ensuring secure and reliable communication between them?
9. How do you ensure that AWS Lambda functions are cost-optimized at scale, and what design patterns would you use to minimize costs?
10. How would you handle the lifecycle of Lambda functions in a large, complex architecture with versioning, aliasing, blue/green deployments, and canary releases?
