### How API Gateway Works in AWS (Step-by-step):

- **API Creation**: Define a REST, HTTP, or WebSocket API in API Gateway.
- **Endpoint Definition**: Specify resources and methods (GET, POST, etc.) for the API.
- **Integration**: Set up backend integrations like Lambda, HTTP, or AWS services.
- **Method Request**: API Gateway receives client requests via defined endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Optionally validate requests using IAM, Cognito, or custom authorizers.
- **Request Transformation**: Modify or validate the request before sending it to the backend.
- **Execution**: API Gateway routes the request to the integrated backend service.
- **Response Handling**: Receive response from the backend and transform it, if needed.
- **Response Delivery**: Send the final response back to the client.
- **Monitoring**: Track API usage and performance via CloudWatch Logs and Metrics.
